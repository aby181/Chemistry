<p>
<H2>In this chemestry experiment we discovered how to find the ph scale of many element just like yogurt, chloride, milk, ice tea etc.<br>
Also showns if the product is sour, acid or basic, it have a scale of numbers to 0-14. 7 is the middle, it means something is neutral,<br>
like water,less than 7 means something  is acid just like a lemon and more than 7 means is a base, like soap. The pH scale helps us understand<br>
if a substance is safe to touch, good to drink, or useful for cleaning. Scientists, farmers, and even people who take care of pools<br>
use the pH scale all the time.<br>

<H1>Hypothesis</H1>
<p>
<H2>If we test cleaning products like soap, baking soda,chloride, then they will have a pH higher than 7 because these<br>
subtances feel slippery or are used for cleaning, and most cleaning products are bases.<br>
So, they will be on the basic side of the pH scale. If a subtance has a low pH number (0-6) then it will be more acid,<br>
if it has a high pH number (8-16) then it will me more basic.<br>
